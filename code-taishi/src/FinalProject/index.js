                <h3 className="h1Tag">Technical Know-How</h3>
                SwahiliPalâ€™s backend utilizes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
                technology to convert spoken language into text. This system is
                designed to accurately recognize and transcribe speech,
                providing users with real-time feedback on their pronunciation.
                Speech Input: Users speak into the app, and the ASR system
                captures their voice. Audio Processing: The system cleans the
                audio to remove background noise and enhances the clarity of the
                speech. Word Recognition: The ASR engine analyzes the cleaned
                audio to identify the spoken words using machine learning
                models. Feedback Mechanism: After processing, the app provides
                instant feedback on pronunciation, helping users improve their
                speaking skills
